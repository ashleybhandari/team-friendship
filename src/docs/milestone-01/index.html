            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In 2023, UMass announced that it would no longer be able to guarantee on-campus
                housing for all undergraduates who requested it. The room selection process ended
                early, leaving 900 students without housing for the fall. These students rushed to
                the UMass Off Campus Housing website, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, Discord, and
                more to blindly message usernames in hopes of coming upon compatible housing and
                roommates. KeyMate was born to ease this effort by centralizing the search process
                and presenting students with important data upfront. Akin to a dating app, each
                user creates a profile in which they describe their traits, habits, and preferences
                surrounding roommates and housing. KeyMate uses this information to tailor each
                user's feed. This way, users can tell whether they like each other at a glance; if
                two users are compatible and interested in each other, they can then safely message
                within the web application before exchanging contact information. Our team hopes
                that this candid and holistic approach to finding potential roommates and housing
                will help mitigate the housing crisis and relieve students' stress. The scope of
                the project is currently limited to UMass Amherst, but should it find success, we
                hope to expand it to other schools.

        <section id="application-parts">
            <h2>Application Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                One critical component of our web application is providing users with the ability
                to tailor their profiles to accurately reflect their preferences and requirements
                for housing and roommates. This feature enables students to input specific
                criteria, such as budget, location preferences, lifestyle habits, and personality
                traits, to match them with suitable housing options and potential roommates. With
                this feature, we ensure that they receive personalized recommendations that align
                with their unique needs and preferences. This not only streamlines the search
                process but also increases the likelihood of finding an ideal housing situation
                that meets their expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second component is a feed that is filtered based on one's preferences. A
                filtering system curates an individual's feed based on their specified roommate
                and housing preferences. This functionality ensures that users are presented with
                listings and roommate profiles that closely match their desired criteria, thereby
                saving time and effort in sorting through irrelevant options. Users can apply
                filters such as location, budget, move-in/move-out dates, listing attributes,
                housing amenities, and roommate preferences to narrow down their options. The
                filtering logic would then process these user-inputted parameters and match them
                against the attributes and details of the available listings and roommate profiles
                in the database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last critical feature is a messaging system for communication. Effective
                communication is essential for facilitating connections between students seeking
                housing and roommates. Therefore, we have integrated a messaging system into our
                application that allows users to safely express their interest in potential
                roommates or housing listings and initiate further contact. This feature allows
                seamless communication between roommates, allowing them to discuss details, arrange
                viewings, and establish compatibility before making any commitments. Additionally,
                the messaging system incorporates safety measures like reporting and blocking
                functionalities to ensure a secure and respectful environment for all users.

            <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
            <p>
                KeyMate was created to support students as they navigate the ongoing housing crisis
                at UMass Amherst. We recognized that finding housing accommodations has become an
                annual stressor for many, including ourselves: one must scour social media in
                search of an open bed that ticks their boxes, have conversations with a myriad of
                strangers, and hope that their personality and lifestyle will help them get chosen
                over other candidates. It is a long and frustrating competition. KeyMate aims to
                transform this process by simplifying how people find each other, thereby
                expediting the overall housing search.
            </p>
            <p>
                The housing crisis has been years in the making: over-admission has caused a
                massive increase in UMass's Amherst's undergraduate population, but construction of
                on-campus housing has not been able to keep pace. In 2023, the university announced
                that, due to a lack of space, it could not guarantee housing accommodations to all
                students who requested them. With this minimal notice, over 900 students suddenly
                found themselves facing housing insecurity. Around 100 students soon pitched their
                tents in the middle of campus for a sleep-in protest. They made the news speaking
                of their experiences, noting the shortage of open beds on campus and high rental
                costs off campus. Protests continue today, demonstrating the pervasiveness of the
                issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inevitable consequence of the university's inaction is competition: there is
                high demand and low supply both on and off campus. Students race the clock to
                secure a dorm room. When the dorms fill up, the rest of the student body is forced
                to compete in Amherst's limited housing market. Rental costs rise in response,
                pushing many into neighboring towns. A web application cannot fix the underlying,
                deep-rooted problem, but it can mitigate the resulting stressors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students use a large variety of websites and social media applications in search
                of open rooms. Most advertisements are informal (such as those posted on Facebook
                Marketplace or Discord), creating two time-consuming issues. First, there is no
                system to filter listings according to one's preferences, so one must keep track of
                listings in which they aren't interested and remember to scroll past them. Second,
                the creation of listings is not guided, so descriptions of the accommodation and
                the people living in it are often lacking. Thus, for every listing with potential,
                one must have a text conversation with the poster just to fill in the gaps and
                decide whether they are actually interested. Depending on how quickly each party
                replies, a single conversation can take days to reach a conclusion. KeyMate solves
                both of these issues by guiding the creation of each listing, thereby ensuring that
                users include the important information. The application optimizes the user's time
                by displaying these listings in a feed: the user can filter the feed to their
                liking, save specific listings, and mark other listings as "Not Interested."
            </p>
            <p>
                KeyMate's goal is to support students. Students already struggle to balance UMass's
                academically rigorous curriculum with their work, hobbies, and social lives. The
                university's inaction has added housing insecurity to this struggle, disrupting the
                balance. Many don't have the capacity to both navigate their regular
                responsibilities and search for the perfect housing—we believe that they shouldn't
                <i>need</i> this capacity. By centralizing and standardizing how students find
                roommates and housing (both on and off campus), KeyMate limits undue stress,
                keeping students focused on what matters.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The development of our web application for helping students find housing and roommates
                ties closely into the integrative experience requirements of our coursework and
                personal experiences. As students who have personally grappled with the challenges of
                housing insecurity and roommate searches, we recognized the need for a dedicated
                platform to address these issues effectively. Our app serves as a one-stop shop for
                looking for housing and roommates because we have provided a messaging system in which
                the user can directly inquire with either the leasing office or the roommate in which
                they are interested about the accommodation, without relying on third-party websites
                such as social media apps or realtor websites. Our project represents the culmination
                of our university education and personal growth, drawing upon specific courses and life
                experiences that have contributed to its development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout our academic journey, courses such as CS 220 and CS 326 have provided us
                with essential knowledge and skills in JavaScript, Typescript, and web development.
                These foundational courses equipped us with the technical expertise necessary to build
                a robust and user-friendly web application. Additionally, CS 325 proved invaluable for
                wireframing and designing the user interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal experiences shared among our team members underscore the real-world relevance
                and necessity of our project. For instance, one of our team members' struggle to find
                someone to sublet her room during breaks highlights the limitations of relying solely
                on personal social media accounts and current online platforms. Similarly, the
                inability of another member to find compatible roommates and housing emphasizes the
                inadequacies of current housing resources available to students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our experiences of navigating housing searches late in the semester and encountering
                difficulties due to specific housing requirements, such as finding roommates willing to
                accommodate an emotional support animal, further underscored the need for a dedicated
                platform tailored to the unique needs of each university student. Our app will work to
                alleviate the stress of many students who face homelessness because they don't have the
                 time or energy to consistently connect with countless people across different
                 platforms. These experiences inspired us to create a solution that addresses these
                 points directly, providing students with a comprehensive and user-centric platform for
                 finding housing and roommates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, our project aligns with the principles of computing for good, as
                emphasized in courses like CICS 305. By creating a platform that addresses the pressing
                needs of students tired of the arduous process of finding suitable housing and
                roommates, we are leveraging technology to make a positive impact on our community. The
                overwhelming interest in KeyMate, as expressed by fellow students, further validates
                the importance and relevance of our project, as well as reinforces our commitment to
                computing for social good.
            </p>
            <p>
                In essence, our web application represents the convergence of our academic careers,
                personal experiences, and commitment to leveraging technology for the betterment of our
                community. By addressing the challenges of housing insecurity and roommate searches, we
                are not only fulfilling the requirements of our coursework, but also making a tangible
                difference in the lives of students.
