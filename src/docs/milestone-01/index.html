            <h2>Application Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                One critical component of our web application is providing users with the ability
                to tailor their profiles to accurately reflect their preferences and requirements
                for housing and roommates. This feature enables students to input specific
                criteria, such as budget, location preferences, lifestyle habits, and personality
                traits, to match them with suitable housing options and potential roommates. With
                this feature, we ensure that they receive personalized recommendations that align
                with their unique needs and preferences. This not only streamlines the search
                process but also increases the likelihood of finding an ideal housing situation
                that meets their expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second critical feature is a feed that is filtered based on one's preferences.
                A filtering system curates an individual's feed based on their specified roommate
                and housing preferences. This functionality ensures that users are presented with
                listings and roommate profiles that closely match their desired criteria, thereby
                saving time and effort in sorting through irrelevant options. Users can apply
                filters such as location, budget, move-in/move-out dates, listing attributes,
                housing amenities, and roommate preferences to narrow down their options. The
                filtering logic would then process these user-inputted parameters and match them
                against the attributes and details of the available listings and roommate profiles
                in the database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last critical feature is a messaging system for communication. Effective
                communication is essential for facilitating connections between students seeking
                housing and roommates. Therefore, we have integrated a messaging system into our
                application that allows users to safely express their interest in potential
                roommates or housing listings and initiate further contact. This feature allows
                seamless communication between roommates, allowing them to discuss details, arrange
                viewings, and establish compatibility before making any commitments. Additionally,
                the messaging system incorporates safety measures like reporting and blocking
                functionalities to ensure a secure and respectful environment for all users.
